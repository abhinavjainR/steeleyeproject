1. Explain what the simple List component does.
Ans: Lists are utilized to show information in an arranged order and mostly used to show menus on sites.

const exampleList = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D','E'];
const TestList = ( ) => (
  <ul>
    {exampleList.map(item => {
      return <li key={item}>{item}</li>;
    })}
  </ul>
);

The list component contains list items.
A single list item is stored inside WrappedSingleListItem that contains 2 values index and text, 
a state named isSelected and an onClick event.

The wrapped list item is then memoized using the memo function, which means that 
react will reuse the list content until the props are same.
Memo function prevents re-rendering on the same element repeatedly.

Items array is used to store these list items and then each item is looped through using map() function 
and displayed. 




2. What problems / warnings is there with code ?
Ans: 
(a) Error in onClick={onClickHandler(index)}. It should give boolean value as onClick={onClickHandler(Boolean(index))}.
(b) Error in definition of the useState() : const [setSelectedIndex, selectedIndex] = useState();
set function would be the 2nd parameter.
(c) Error in definition of  WrappedListComponent.propTypes - It should be arrayOf instead of shapeOf.
(d) Definitions of items is null in WrappedListComponent.defaultProps. It will not be mapped otherwise 
   
    WrappedListComponent.defaultProps = {
     items: null,
        };
